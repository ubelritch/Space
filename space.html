<h1 class="white"> The End of the Universe </h1>
<p> My <a href="#friend" style="color:#EC6262">friend</a>, are you tired of staying one place all your life? </p>
<p>    One day let's go into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.space.com/" style="color:#CCE5FF">space</a>! </p>
<ol class="white"> In the meanwhile, there are some poems, too: 
<li class="white"> <a href="#galaxy" style="color:#CCE5FF"> The Galaxy </a></li>
<li class="white"> <a href="#comet" style="color:#CCE5FF"> The Comet </a></li>
</ol>


<h2 class="white" id="galaxy"> The Galaxy </h2>
<h4 class="white"> Henry Wadsworth Longfellow </h4> 
<p> Torrent of light and river of the air, <br>
Along whose bed the glimmering stars are seen <br>
Like gold and silver sands in some ravine<br>
Where mountain streams have left their channels bare!<br>
The Spaniard sees in thee the pathway, where<br>
His patron saint descended in the sheen<br>
Of his celestial armor, on serene<br>
And quiet nights, when all the heavens were fair.<br>
Not this I see, nor yet the ancient fable<br>
Of Phaeton's wild course, that scorched the skies<br>
Where'er the hoofs of his hot coursers trod;<br>
But the white drift of worlds o'er chasms of sable,<br>
The star-dust that is whirled aloft and flies<br>
From the invisible chariot-wheels of God.</p>

<h2 class="white"> The Comet </h2>
<h4 class="white"> Oliver Wendell Holmes </h4>
<p> The Comet! He is on his way, <br>
And singing as he flies;</p>
<p class="black">The whizzing planets shrink before<br>
The spectre of the skies;<br>
Ah! well may regal orbs burn blue,<br>
And satellites turn pale,<br>
Ten million cubic miles of head,<br>
Ten billion leagues of tail!</p>


<h2 class="black"> Yeah so this is the End</h2>
<p class="black"> There's nothing more out of this.<br>
Things are ephemeral.<br>
All are ought to vanish.<br>
But in a lifetime, 
<p class="black" id=friend> We've been each other's  friend.</p>
